# Healthcare Product Analytics  
End-to-End Product Analytics using SQL, Python and Power BI

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Product Analytics workflow using a healthcare e-commerce use case (inspired by platforms like Tata 1mg).

The objective is to analyze user behavior, retention, and repeat purchases, and convert insights into product and business decisions.

The project showcases how SQL, Python, and Power BI are used together in a real-world analytics setup.

## Business Problem

Healthcare e-commerce platforms depend heavily on:
- User retention
- Repeat purchases (refills)
- Category-level behavior

This project answers questions such as:
- How many users return after their first order?
- Where do users drop off in the lifecycle?
- Which categories drive repeat usage?
- How can product teams improve retention?

## Tech Stack

- SQL (MS SQL Server) – Data preparation, metrics, cohort tables  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) – Cohort analysis, retention curves, experimentation  
- Power BI – Interactive dashboards for stakeholders  
- GitHub – Version control and project sharing
